## Project Overview

Airplane crashes are tragic events that have shaped aviation safety policies and technological advancements over the years. This project analyzes global airplane crashes and associated fatalities from 1908 - 2009. The goal is to identify trends in crash occurrences, understand factors contributing to aviation accidents, and highlight key safety improvements over time. Using data visualization techniques, we uncover insights into the deadliest periods in aviation history, airline accident patterns, and potential causes of crashes.

## About the Dataset

* Time Span: 1908 ‚Äì 2009:
* Date: Date of crash occurrence
* Location: Country and city of the accident
* Operator: Airline or organization operating the aircraft
* Aircraft Type: Model and manufacturer of the aircraft
* Aboard: Total people on board
* Fatalities: Total number of deaths
* Summary: Brief description of the crash


## Data Quality & Data Cleaning Preparation Assessments

1. Missing Values: Some entries in the dataset had missing operator names, aircraft models, or accident summaries. These were either filled using available sources or marked as "Unknown."
2. Duplicates: Duplicate records were identified and removed to avoid data redundancy.
3. Date Formatting: The date column was converted to a standard YYYY-MM-DD format for consistency.
4. Standardization of Operator Names: Airlines with different spellings were standardized.
5. Fatalities Calculation: Derived new metrics such as Total Fatalities by calculating ''' Total Fatalities = SUM('Airplane_Crashes_and_Fatalities'[Fatalities])'''

## Dashboard Overview
The interactive dashboard consists of multiple sections:
