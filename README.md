## Project Overview

Airplane crashes are tragic events that have shaped aviation safety policies and technological advancements over the years. This project analyzes global airplane crashes and associated fatalities from 1908 - 2009. The goal is to identify trends in crash occurrences, understand factors contributing to aviation accidents, and highlight key safety improvements over time. Using data visualization techniques, we uncover insights into the deadliest periods in aviation history, airline accident patterns, and potential causes of crashes.

## About the Dataset

* Time Span: 1908 – 2009:
* Date: Date of crash occurrence
* Location: Country and city of the accident
* Operator: Airline or organization operating the aircraft
* Aircraft Type: Model and manufacturer of the aircraft
* Aboard: Total people on board
* Fatalities: Total number of deaths
* Summary: Brief description of the crash


## Data Quality & Data Cleaning Preparation Assessments

1. Missing Values: Some entries in the dataset had missing operator names, aircraft models, or accident summaries. These were either filled using available sources or marked as "Unknown."
2. Duplicates: Duplicate records were identified and removed to avoid data redundancy.
3. Date Formatting: The date column was converted to a standard YYYY-MM-DD format for consistency.
4. Standardization of Operator Names: Airlines with different spellings were standardized.


## Dashboard Overview
The interactive dashboard consists of multiple sections:

 82K fatalities occurred during clear weather, suggesting human error or mechanical issues were more significant than weather conditions.


## Insights and Recommendations 

 * Stronger Safety Protocols in High-Risk Regions with frequent accidents.
 * Mandatory Retirement of Older Aircraft Models based on crash data.
 * Increased Focus on Pilot Training Programs to minimize human error.
 * Expansion of Real-Time Weather Monitoring to reduce weather-related crashes.
 * Implementation of Advanced AI-based Aircraft Diagnostics to predict mechanical failures before takeoff.

## Conclusions (6 Key Takeaways)
1️⃣ The number of crashes has significantly decreased post-2000 due to technological advancements and improved safety measures.

2️⃣ Fatality rates are highest in older aircraft models, highlighting the need for better retirement policies.

3️⃣ Certain regions experience more crashes, suggesting a need for enhanced air traffic control and safety regulations in those areas.

4️⃣ Major airlines with past crash records have improved their safety procedures, showing how regulation enforcement has worked.

5️⃣ Human error remains a leading cause of accidents, reinforcing the need for better pilot training and AI assistance in aviation.

6️⃣ Continuous improvements in aircraft design, technology, and safety protocols will further reduce the risk of future airplane crashes.


Airlines can use these insights to reduce crash rates and improve passenger safety.
